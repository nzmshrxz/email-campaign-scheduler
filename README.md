npm install

## Set up .env file

Create a .env file in the root based on .env.example. It should include:

SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@example.com
SMTP_PASS=your_password
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string

npm start
Visit http://localhost:3000/create to create a campaign.

## ðŸ“¬ Scheduling Emails
This app uses node-cron to automatically send emails at the scheduled time.
Once a campaign is created with a future scheduled time, the job scheduler checks every minute and dispatches emails accordingly.

âœ… No manual action is needed after scheduling â€” emails are sent automatically based on the scheduled time.
